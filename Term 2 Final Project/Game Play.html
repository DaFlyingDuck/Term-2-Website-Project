<h2>Game Play</h2>

<div class="main">

<img class="launch" src="launch.gif">

<p>Players create rockets, rovers, spaceplanes, and aircraft in order to complete in-game missions or self-directed goals whilst (hopefully) not crashing. Once built the player launches their creation and (attempt to) control it whilst managing their fuel, thrust, velocity, aerodyanmics, orbital manuevers and much more.</p>

<h4>Why Is Game So Famous?</h4>

<p class="center">The hysterical nature of being able to stick your pilot on the side of a self-designed F-1 going Mach 2(that you're suprised even made it off the runway) and the ability to create almost anything within the physics engine draws players from around the world.
