<p>Players create rockets, rovers, spaceplanes, and aircraft in order to complete in-game missions or self-directed goals whilst (hopefully) not crashing. Once built the player launches their creation and (attempt to) control it whilst managing their fuel, thrust, velocity, aerodyanmics, orbital manuevers and much more.</p>
