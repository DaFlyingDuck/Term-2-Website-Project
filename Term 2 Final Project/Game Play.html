<h2>Game Play</h2>

<div class="maingameplay">


<img class="launch" src="launch.gif">

<p>Players create rockets, rovers, spaceplanes, and aircraft in order to complete in-game missions or self-directed goals whilst (hopefully) not crashing. Once built the player launches their creation and (attempt to) control it whilst managing their fuel, thrust, velocity, aerodyanmics, orbital manuevers and much more.</p>

<h4>Why Is Game So Famous?</h4>

<p class="center">The hysterical nature of being able to stick your pilot on the side of a self-designed F-1 going Mach 2(that you're suprised even made it off the runway) and the ability to create almost anything within the physics engine draws players from around the world.

<h5 class="vab">VAB</h5>

<img class="vab" src="vab.png">

<p class="center">First and foremost, the VAB or Vehicle Assembly Building along with the Spaceplane Hangar are the 2 buildings in which players can create their *ahem*explosive devices*ahem* inventions to test and *hopefully* make fly. This is essentially where all flying machines get designed and tweaked with the help of the large selection of over 500 parts.

<img class="rover" src="rover.jpg">

<h5 class="rover">Rovers</h5>

<p>Including Rovers which allow players to explore the surface of celestial bodies they land on and perform science activities.</p>

<img class="spaceplane" src="spaceplane.jpg">

<h5 class="spaceplane">Spaceplanes</h5>

<p>Spaceplanes that can difficult to create but reward the player with low flight cost.</p>

<img class="aircraft" src="aircraft.jpg">

<h5 class="aircraft">Aircraft</h5>

<p>Or just regular old airplanes and jets... But don't forget this is Kerbal Space Program so your plane will usually end up looking like this instead...

<h5>Space Stations</h5>

<p>And finally the pinnacle of kerbal technology... The Space Station!!!</p> <p>Today we've been lucky enough to observe the outpost in its natural habitat; undergoing rapid unplanned disassembly and atmospheric insertion where we will get to see the station perform its newest breakthrough technology near the end... Lithobraking!!!</p>
